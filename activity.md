#### 2023 IMC Prosperity Trading
IMC prosperity trading is a 10-day continuously high-frequency trading challenge. Every year, 7000+ teams, which each consist of five members, attend this competition. The competition is designed for high-frequency trading of virtual assets, and competitors are required to write python files to execute algorimic trading and also utilize their knowledge in finance, business, mathematics, economics, etc to make manual trading.

This competition let me have more experience about high-frequency trading. Five rounds include content about money making, position taking, pair trading, hedging, trend prediction (and following), seasonal products, derivatives, etc. This is a very good trading challenge for beginner quant researchers and traders.
