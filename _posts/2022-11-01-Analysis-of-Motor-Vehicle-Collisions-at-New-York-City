### Description:
Motor vehicle collisions do result in a significant number of fatalities every year. 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), road traffic injuries were the leading cause of death for people aged 5-29 years in 2019, 
\resulting in an estimated 1.35 million deaths worldwide. The number of fatalities can vary by country and region, 
and NYC is a severe region. Currently, NYPD only gives some basic analysis, such as visualization and statistics, 
for motor vehicle collisions. 

To further explore it, our group encode the original data to include more information in a tidy format with more details, 
such as date, street, people density, vehicle type, etc. We then employ linear models and tree models to detect
which factors may highly be correlated to the injured and kill during motor vehicle collisions to help the social 
department dispatch different powers and assistance and reduce the possibility of severe collision in city region.
